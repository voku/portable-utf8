# Extracted data integration candidate

This branch requires `voku/portable-utf8-emoji-data:^1.0`, retaining full functionality by default.
The data repository is https://github.com/voku/portable-utf8-emoji-data; its reviewed development commit
is `74c440f6dcaeda3daa9fbef9cd513619d3c4aeae`. There are no stable mapping tags yet. This branch cannot be consumed
as a normal stable dependency until its separate version/migration gate is approved.

## Local development without publication

```sh
COMPOSER="$(php build/footprint/development-composer.php)" composer update --prefer-dist
php vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml
```

The helper writes a temporary application manifest with absolute checkout paths, a VCS
repository and a pinned `dev-main#<sha> as 1.0.0` provider alias. It installs the checkout's
vendor directory without altering the production manifest or requiring a release tag.
Composer reads branch metadata; retain the generated lockfile and reviewed provider manifest.

## Explicit application opt-out

A root application can declare `replace: {"voku/portable-utf8-emoji-data": "1.0.0"}` only after auditing
its executed paths. This deliberately suppresses installation rather than implementing
equivalent functionality. Pin the reviewed data version; never use `*`. A reached missing
provider throws an actionable RuntimeException rather than silently changing outputs.

Nonempty emoji_encode/emoji_decode, strrev and is_html reach this provider, including plain ASCII input. Other encoding/repair/support paths retain their core metadata.

Direct consumers of `src/voku/helper/data/emoji.php` must migrate to
`Voku\PortableUtf8EmojiData\EmojiMap::load()`; those internal files are removed in this candidate.
Public library signatures and retained byte/language/support data remain unchanged.
Do not merge or publish this as a compatibility-only patch: moved paths/new dependencies
require their own major-version/migration review. Roll back by reverting this extraction
commit; the earlier in-place branch remains available.

## Version compatibility

The provider-major-1 contract preserves ordered arrays, identifiers and the known mapping
set. Any incompatible provider/API change requires a new major version. If a core change
needs data added in a later minor release, raise the core requirement minimum accordingly;
otherwise an older pinned replacement can still satisfy `^1.0`. Pin the actual audited
minimum in an opt-out declaration and reassess it on dependency upgrades.

This development integration does not set core release versions, add tags or authorize a
release. Library public signatures remain stable; internal data paths and Composer requirements
change and need the separate migration gate described above.
